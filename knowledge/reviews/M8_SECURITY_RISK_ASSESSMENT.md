## Issue-by-Issue Assessment

### Issue #97 - Container Image Scanning (Trivy)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Evidence:** `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Base Images | 4 scanned weekly |
| Custom Images | 8 scanned on PR |
| SARIF Integration | ✅ GitHub Security tab |
| Exit on CRITICAL | ✅ Custom images only |

**Risk:** LOW - Scanning operational, gosu CVEs documented as accepted.

---

### Issue #98 - Container Hardening (Non-Root, Minimal Images)
**Status:** ✅ DOCUMENTED
**Evidence:** `docs/security/CONTAINER_HARDENING.md`

| Control | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Non-root users | ✅ All Dockerfiles |
| Alpine base | ✅ All services |
| No shell | ⚠️ Partial (debug needs shell) |
| Read-only FS | ❌ Not implemented |

**Risk:** LOW - Core hardening in place.

---

### Issue #99 - Penetration Test - Web Application
**Status:** 🔴 BLOCKED
**Reason:** Requires external pentesting firm

**Gap Analysis:**
- No external security validation
- Internal code review not sufficient
- OWASP ZAP not implemented

**Risk:** HIGH - Critical gap for production.

**Recommendation:**
- Budget allocation for pentest (Q1 2026)
- Interim: Run OWASP ZAP API scan manually

---

### Issue #100 - Penetration Test - Infrastructure
**Status:** 🔴 BLOCKED
**Reason:** Requires external pentesting firm

**Risk:** HIGH - Same as #99.

---

### Issue #101 - Redis Authentication & Hardening
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Evidence:** Docker Compose with `REDIS_PASSWORD`

| Control | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Password auth | ✅ Required |
| ACL (per-user) | ❌ Not implemented |
| TLS | ⚠️ Internal only |
| Disable KEYS/FLUSHALL | ❌ Not implemented |

**Risk:** LOW - Basic auth in place, ACL enhancement optional.

---

### Issue #102 - PostgreSQL RBAC & Hardening
**Status:** ✅ DOCUMENTED
**Evidence:** `docs/security/POSTGRES_HARDENING.md`

| Control | Status |
|---------|--------|
| SSL/TLS | ✅ verify-ca ready |
| Non-default user | ✅ claire_user |
| RBAC roles | ⚠️ Documented, not implemented |
| Connection limits | ⚠️ Documented, not implemented |
| Cert rotation | ⚠️ Script ready |

**Risk:** MEDIUM - Docs complete, implementation pending.

---

### Issue #103 - Penetration Test - API
**Status:** 🔴 MERGED with #99

---

### Issue #104 - Penetration Test - Network
**Status:** 🔴 MERGED with #100

---

### Issue #105 - Incident Response Playbook
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Evidence:** `docs/security/INCIDENT_RESPONSE_PLAYBOOK.md`

| Section | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Severity Classification | ✅ SEV-1 to SEV-4 |
| Detection Procedures | ✅ Auto + Manual |
| Triage Guidelines | ✅ Decision Tree |
| Escalation Matrix | ⚠️ TBD placeholders |
| Communication Plan | ✅ Templates |
| Response Procedures | ✅ 4 scenarios |
| Recovery Steps | ✅ Documented |
| Post-Mortem Template | ✅ Included |
| Drill Schedule | ⚠️ TBD dates |

**Risk:** LOW - Comprehensive playbook, needs drill validation.

---

### Issue #106 - OWASP Top 10 Audit
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Evidence:** `docs/security/OWASP_TOP10_AUDIT.md`

| OWASP Category | Status | Findings |
|----------------|--------|----------|
| A01 Broken Access | ✅ Pass | None |
| A02 Crypto Failures | ✅ Pass | None |
| A03 Injection | ⚠️ MEDIUM | shell=True |
| A04 Insecure Design | ✅ Pass | None |
| A05 Misconfiguration | ⚠️ MEDIUM | sslmode=prefer |
| A06 Vulnerable Comp | ✅ Pass | Monitored |
| A07 Auth Failures | ✅ Pass | None |
| A08 Integrity | ✅ Pass | None |
| A09 Logging | ⚠️ LOW | Enhancement |
| A10 SSRF | ✅ Pass | None |

**Result:** 0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM, 3 LOW
**Risk:** LOW - Solid baseline, minor fixes needed.

|-------|------------|--------|
| A01 | Internal architecture (no public UI) | ✅ |
| A02 | Docker Secrets, SSL | ✅ |
| A03 | Code review, static analysis | ⚠️ |
| A04 | Kill-switch, circuit breakers | ✅ |
| A05 | Container hardening, security-scan.yml | ⚠️ |

## Missing Security Controls

### MUST Have (Before Production)
1. ❌ **External Penetration Test** - Blocked on budget/vendor
2. ❌ **SAST in CI** - Bandit installed but not in workflow
3. ❌ **Rate Limiting WebSocket** - H-01 Finding open

### SHOULD Have
4. ⚠️ **PostgreSQL RBAC** - Documented, needs execution
5. ⚠️ **Drill Validation** - Playbook not tested
6. ⚠️ **DAST Scanning** - OWASP ZAP recommended

### NICE to Have
7. 📅 **Row-Level Security** - Multi-tenant future
8. 📅 **WAF** - If public exposure needed
9. 📅 **SIEM Integration** - Centralized security logs

---

## Timeline Feasibility

**Original Target:** Q2 2026
**Assessment:** FEASIBLE with conditions

| Condition | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Pentest budget approved | ❓ Unknown |
| SAST/DAST added to CI | Can be done in 1 day |
| PostgreSQL RBAC executed | Can be done in 1 day |
| Incident drill completed | Can be done in 1 day |

**Recommendation:** Proceed with documented controls, block on pentest.

---

## Recommendations

### P0 - Immediate (This Week)
1. Add Bandit to CI workflow
2. Add pip-audit to CI workflow
3. Fix shell=True in smart_startup.py
4. Set POSTGRES_SSLMODE=require in prod compose

### P1 - Short Term (January 2026)
5. Execute PostgreSQL RBAC migration
6. Implement WebSocket rate limiting
7. Run first incident response drill
8. Add OWASP ZAP baseline scan

### P2 - Before M9 (Q2 2026)
9. Complete external penetration test
10. Address all pentest findings
11. Security sign-off for production

---

## Conclusion

The M8 Security Roadmap is **70% complete** with documentation.
**Critical blocker:** External penetration testing (#99, #100).

**Overall Risk:** MEDIUM
- Strong documentation foundation
- CI security scanning operational
- Implementation gaps in RBAC and rate limiting
- No external validation yet

**Next Steps:**
1. Request pentest budget approval
2. Execute P0 recommendations
3. Schedule first incident drill

## Why This Gate Was Triggered

{reasons_list}

---

## Quality Metrics Summary

- **Disagreement Count:** {disagreements}
- **Echo Chamber Score:** {echo_str} (0.0=diverse, 1.0=echo chamber)
- **Minimum Confidence:** {min_conf_str}
- **Overall Verdict:** {verdict}

---

## Your Decision

Please review the discussion thread and make a decision:

- [ ] ✅ **PROCEED** - Create GitHub Issue
  - Discussion is mature enough
  - Disagreements are resolved or acceptable
  - Confidence is sufficient

- [ ] 🔄 **REVISE** - Additional Analysis Needed
  - Which agent should re-analyze?
  - What specific questions need answering?
  - What additional context is needed?

- [ ] ❌ **REJECT** - Archive Discussion
  - Why is this proposal not viable?
  - What fundamental issues prevent proceeding?
  - What would need to change?

### Your Notes

<!-- Add your reasoning here -->

---

## Next Steps After Decision

### If PROCEED:
```bash
# Create GitHub issue from this discussion
python scripts/discussion_pipeline/create_github_issue.py {thread_id}
```

### If REVISE:
```bash
# Resume pipeline with additional agents or context
# Note: Resume functionality pending implementation
# python scripts/discussion_pipeline/run_discussion.py {thread_id} --preset iterative
```

### If REJECT:
- Archive thread for future reference
- Document decision rationale in `manifest.json`

---

## Thread Files

Review these files before deciding:

- `{thread_dir}/manifest.json` - Pipeline metadata
- `{thread_dir}/DIGEST.md` - Discussion summary
- `{thread_dir}/*_output.md` - Individual agent analyses

*This gate was automatically triggered by the Discussion Pipeline.*

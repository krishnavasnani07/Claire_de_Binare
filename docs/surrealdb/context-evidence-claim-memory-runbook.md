# Context Evidence, Claim, Decision, and Memory Retrieval Runbook

## 1. Purpose and Scope

- Part of Wave 14 (#2115–#2128) of Epic #1976 (Context Intelligence System)
- Operator/agent-facing guide for safe use of Evidence Lookup, Claim Resolution,
  Decision History/Replay, Scoped Memory Read, Trust Summary, and Briefing Enrichment tools
- Scope: read-only context retrieval — no writes, no live capital, no Echtgeld-Go
- Prerequisite: Issues #2116–#2126 CLOSED; #2122 (Briefing Enrichment) partially open (see Section 9)

**LR-Status: NO-GO** — this runbook covers context tooling only.
No runtime, trading, or live-capital implication.

## 3. When to Use Which Tool

| Use Case | Tool | Timing |
|----------|------|--------|
| Find evidence backing a claim or artifact | `cdb_context_evidence_resolve` | Before accepting a claim as fact |
| Resolve claim status (supported/disputed/stale) | `cdb_context_claim_resolve` | Before acting on a claim |
| Review what decisions were made and why | `cdb_context_decision_history` | Before repeating or contradicting a past decision |
| Replay a decision chain for audit | `cdb_context_decision_replay` | During post-mortem or governance review |
| Read scoped memory about a task/scope | `cdb_context_memory_get` | As a hint before starting work |
| Assess overall trust level of context | `cdb_context_trust_summary` | After gathering evidence/claims/memory |
| Enrich an agent briefing with above | `cdb_context_briefing` | Before acting on any scoped task |

**Recommended order:**
1. Evidence Lookup → 2. Claim Resolution → 3. Decision History →
4. Memory Read → 5. Trust Summary → 6. Briefing Enrichment

## 6. Interpreting Trust Summary Output

| Trust Level | Score Range | Interpretation |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| `blocked` | < 0.30 | Do not proceed. Missing or contradicted evidence. Stop condition. |
| `weak` | 0.30–0.54 | Proceed with explicit human approval. Flag all gaps. |
| `acceptable` | 0.55–0.79 | Proceed with caution. Verify key evidence before action. |
| `strong` | ≥ 0.80 | Evidence is solid. Proceed normally; document evidence trail. |

**Guardrails:**
- Trust level is derived from in-memory records only — it is a **hint**, not a certification.
- A `strong` trust level does not authorize live capital, runtime change, or Echtgeld-Go.
- A `blocked` trust level must always produce a stop condition in the briefing.
- Missing evidence must be treated as a blocker for critical paths.
- Stale/weak/disputed evidence must be surfaced, not silently dropped.

---

## 7. Handling Missing, Stale, and Disputed Evidence

### Missing Evidence

- If `lookup_evidence_v1` returns an empty result for a critical artifact, produce a
  `missing_evidence` stop condition.
- Do not proceed or guess. Block the action path.
- Document which artifact and which claim was unresolvable.

```
Stop condition: S5 — missing evidence resolution
Required: evidence for <artifact_id> before proceeding.
```

### Stale Evidence

- `by_freshness` mode returns only records with `created_at` within the `freshness_days`
  window; older records are excluded, not marked `stale: true`.
- The `stale: true` flag is read from the record itself — `lookup_evidence_v1` does not
  compute staleness from age.
- Stale evidence contributes negatively to the trust score.
- Operator must review and re-verify before treating stale evidence as current.

### Stale/Superseded Memory

- Memory records with exceeded TTL are flagged `stale: true` by `read_memory_v1`.
- Superseded memory records are returned with status `superseded`.
- **Memory is a hint, not ground truth.** Never block solely on memory; never trust
  superseded memory without re-validation.

### Disputed Claims

- Claims in status `disputed` lower the trust score significantly.
- Disputed claims must be surfaced in `missing_evidence_notice` and
  `contradictory_evidence_notice` of the briefing.
- Do not act on disputed claims without human review.

---

## 8. Human-GO Boundaries

The following actions **always require explicit human GO** regardless of trust level:

| Action | Required GO |
|--------|-------------|
| Live capital deployment | GO LIVE (LR gate — currently NO-GO) |
| Echtgeld trading | GO ECHTGELD (LR gate — currently NO-GO) |
| Strategy validation | Human Gate |
| Merge of code changes | GO MERGE |
| Push to main | GO PUSH |
| Issue close / comment | GO GITHUB LIVE |
| Admin merge (bypass policy) | GO ADMIN MERGE |
| Review thread resolve | GO REVIEW THREAD RESOLVE |
| Commit | GO COMMIT |

**No context tool output — regardless of trust level — substitutes for these human GO signals.**

---

## 9. Current Status: Briefing Enrichment (#2122)

As of Wave-14 PR #2343, `context_bridge.py` includes placeholder Briefing Enrichment fields
(`enriched_evidence`, `enriched_decisions`, `enriched_memory`), but **does not yet call**
`lookup_evidence_v1`, `resolve_claims_v1`, `read_memory_v1`, or `build_trust_summary_v1`.

- Issue #2122 is **OPEN**.
- The Wave-14 MCP tools (`cdb_context_evidence_resolve`, `cdb_context_claim_resolve`,
  `cdb_context_memory_get`, `cdb_context_trust_summary`, `cdb_context_decision_history`,
  `cdb_context_decision_replay`) are implemented as adapter functions but are **not yet
  registered in `tools/mcp/registry.py`**.
- Until PR 2 (code slice) merges, the Briefing Enrichment fields return empty lists and
  the trust summary is a partial-mode string.

This does **not** affect Wave-14 read-only retrieval services (#2116–#2121), which are
fully functional and tested (53 tests passing).

## 11. Guardrails Summary

- **No Write** — every tool in Wave 14 is read-only. No evidence write, no decision write,
  no memory write, no repo write.
- **No Live-Go** — LR-STATUS remains NO-GO. No context tool output authorizes live capital.
- **No Echtgeld-Go** — Board-Stage `trade-capable` is orthogonal to LR; does not authorize
  real money.
- **Fail-closed** — if evidence is missing or trust is `blocked`, the tool stops and reports,
  never guesses.
- **Memory is a hint** — memory records must not be treated as authoritative system state.
- **Decisions explain history** — decision replay provides audit trace only; it does not
  re-execute or authorize anything.
- `approval_semantics.no_echtgeld_go: true` is carried in every tool response.

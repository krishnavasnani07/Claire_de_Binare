# Integration via Docker Desktop for Claire de Binare

## Introduction

Claire de Binare is an autonomous trading bot system composed of multiple microservices (containers) orchestrated via Docker Compose. As of the latest status, the project has **9 containers** (services) that are running and considered production-ready[\[1\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docs/MANIFEST.md#L73-L78). To enhance scalability, resiliency, and alignment with modern deployment practices, the next step is to integrate or **migrate this setup to Kubernetes**, using Docker Desktop’s built-in Kubernetes cluster for local testing. This document consolidates the existing data/configuration and validates it against best practices, providing a comprehensive guide to running the Claire de Binare stack on Kubernetes (remember: **“KU-BA-NE-TIS”** 😉).

## Current Architecture Overview

Before migrating, it’s important to recap the system’s architecture and services:

* **Data Ingestion Layer:**

* *WebSocket Screener* (bot\_ws container) – connects to the MEXC exchange’s WebSocket to stream market data. Exposes an HTTP health endpoint on port 8000[\[2\]](../ops/RUNBOOK_DOCKER_OPERATIONS.md).

* *REST Screener* (bot\_rest container) – fetches periodic data from REST API (currently optional/disabled)[\[3\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docs/SYSTEM_FLUSSDIAGRAMM.md#L16-L24)[\[4\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docs/SYSTEM_FLUSSDIAGRAMM.md#L18-L26) and runs on port 8080[\[2\]](../ops/RUNBOOK_DOCKER_OPERATIONS.md).

* **Message Bus:**

* *Redis* – acts as a Pub/Sub message broker (e.g., broadcasting market data to downstream services). In Docker it runs on port 6379, with a password set for authentication[\[5\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docker-compose.yml#L14-L22). Other services subscribe/publish to Redis channels (e.g., market\_data, signals topics).

* **Processing Layer:**

* *Signal Engine* (signal\_engine container) – processes incoming market data and generates trading signals (e.g., detects momentum \> 3% in 15min)[\[6\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/backoffice/services/signal_engine/README.md#L12-L20)[\[7\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/backoffice/services/signal_engine/README.md#L22-L30). It subscribes to Redis topic market\_data and publishes to signals[\[8\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docs/SYSTEM_FLUSSDIAGRAMM.md#L50-L58). Runs on port 8001 and provides a /health endpoint[\[9\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docker-compose.yml#L180-L188)[\[10\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/backoffice/services/signal_engine/README.md#L44-L50).

* *Risk Manager* (risk\_manager container) – consumes signals and applies risk rules (position limits, etc.), then publishes validated orders to a Redis orders channel[\[11\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docs/SYSTEM_FLUSSDIAGRAMM.md#L52-L60). Listens on port 8002 with similar health/metrics endpoints.

* *Execution Service* (execution\_service container) – consumes orders and executes trades (in this case, interacts with a **mock trading executor** for paper trading)[\[12\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docs/SYSTEM_FLUSSDIAGRAMM.md#L56-L64). It writes orders/trades to the database and provides a REST API for results (port 8003\)[\[13\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docs/SYSTEM_FLUSSDIAGRAMM.md#L68-L71).

* **Storage Layer:**

* *PostgreSQL* – stores persistent data such as executed orders and trades. Runs on port 5432 with a database claire\_de\_binare and user cdb\_user[\[14\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docker-compose.yml#L32-L40). Services connect using this DB for persistence (e.g., Execution logs trades).

* **Monitoring Layer:**

* *Prometheus* – collects metrics from services (each service exposes /metrics). Runs on port 9090[\[15\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docker-compose.yml#L53-L61) and is configured via a prometheus.yml (which in Docker was bind-mounted) to scrape the relevant endpoints.

* *Grafana* – provides dashboards for monitoring, sourcing data from Prometheus. Runs on port 3000[\[16\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docker-compose.yml#L73-L81) (with credentials admin / *password* from env).

Additionally, there is a *Signal Generator* utility (signal\_generator container) which generates fake signals for testing. It’s not part of the main data flow, but publishes random signals to the signals channel in Redis to simulate the Signal Engine[\[17\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/signal_generator.py#L112-L120). This is useful for testing the Risk Manager and Execution in the absence of real market data.

**Inter-service dependencies:** The microservices form a pipeline. For example, **WebSocket Screener → Redis (market\_data) → Signal Engine → Redis (signals) → Risk Manager → Redis (orders) → Execution Service**, as documented in the system flowchart[\[8\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docs/SYSTEM_FLUSSDIAGRAMM.md#L50-L58)[\[18\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docs/SYSTEM_FLUSSDIAGRAMM.md#L54-L62). This means when deploying on Kubernetes, we must ensure these services can discover each other (via DNS/service names) and start in an order that allows upstream dependencies (like Redis, Postgres) to be ready first. In Docker Compose, all containers run on a shared network (cdb\_network) so they reach each other by container name; we’ll replicate that connectivity with Kubernetes Services.

**Stability:** Initially, some components (Signal, Risk, Execution) were placeholders (not fully implemented)[\[19\]](../ops/RUNBOOK_DOCKER_OPERATIONS.md), but recent development has completed their basic functionality. Documentation shows the Signal Engine implementation with version 0.1.0-alpha and a functioning /health check, graceful shutdown, etc.[\[20\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docs/reports/SIGNAL_ENGINE_COMPLETE.md#L34-L41)[\[21\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docs/reports/SIGNAL_ENGINE_COMPLETE.md#L35-L39). By now, all four core services (Screener WS/REST, Signal, Risk, Execution) are running and *need to be kept stable*. Our Kubernetes setup will include all of them, but we will pay special attention to these newer components (e.g. using readiness probes to verify they connect properly to Redis/DB). The infrastructure services (Redis, Postgres, Prometheus, Grafana) were already running stably under Docker and should translate smoothly to Kubernetes.

## Setting Up Kubernetes on Docker Desktop

First, ensure your environment is prepared:

* **Enable Kubernetes in Docker Desktop:** In Docker Desktop settings, enable the Kubernetes feature (usually under *Settings \> Kubernetes* or *Settings \> Beta features*, tick *Enable Kubernetes* and apply)[\[22\]](https://appdev24.com/pages/58#:~:text=). This will launch a single-node Kubernetes cluster within Docker Desktop.

* **kubectl Configuration:** Install kubectl if not already available. Docker Desktop typically bundles a kubectl or you can install it separately. Confirm that kubectl is pointing to the Docker Desktop cluster: kubectl config get-contexts should list a context like "docker-desktop" and it should be the current context.

* **Resource Allocation:** Ensure Docker Desktop has enough resources (CPU, memory) allocated for the Kubernetes node. The Docker Compose setup required \~4GB RAM free[\[23\]](../ops/RUNBOOK_DOCKER_OPERATIONS.md), so give at least that to Docker’s Kubernetes node.

* **File Sharing for Volumes:** If you plan to use any host path volumes for persistence (common on Docker Desktop), make sure the host directories are in the Docker Desktop File Sharing list. For example, if on Windows you will mount a path from C:\\Users\\..., that drive must be shared in Docker settings[\[24\]](https://appdev24.com/pages/58#:~:text=,where%20data%20will%20be%20stored). On Mac, similarly ensure the intended path is under your user’s allowed file sharing paths.

Once Kubernetes is enabled, test it: kubectl get nodes should show one node ready. We will deploy all services to this local cluster.

## Preparing Container Images

In Kubernetes, we deploy containers using images. We need to ensure all the Claire de Binare services have Docker images available to the cluster:

* **Build the images:** The project repository includes Dockerfiles for each service (or build contexts in the compose). For instance, Dockerfile (for both bot\_ws and bot\_rest via build args), backoffice/services/signal\_engine/Dockerfile, etc., and a scripts/build\_all\_images.ps1 script to build them all[\[25\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/scripts/build_all_images.ps1#L14-L22)[\[26\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/scripts/build_all_images.ps1#L34-L42). Run these builds on your machine to produce images for:

* cdb\_screener\_ws:latest

* cdb\_screener\_rest:latest

* cdb\_signal:latest

* cdb\_risk:latest

* cdb\_execution:latest (if an image exists/needed; the script didn’t include execution, possibly build similarly if code is ready)

* cdb\_signal\_gen:latest (from Dockerfile.signal\_gen)

* plus use official images for redis, postgres, prom, grafana as before.

* **Image availability:** Because this Kubernetes cluster is local (inside Docker Desktop), it shares the same Docker daemon or image store as your Docker engine. That means any image you build locally with Docker should be directly usable by Kubernetes pods (no need to push to a registry) – the Docker Desktop Kubernetes can pull from local images. After building, you can verify by listing images (docker images | grep cdb\_) and seeing the tags[\[27\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/scripts/build_all_images.ps1#L54-L63). If for some reason Kubernetes can’t find them, one workaround is to use the same image names and tags as in Compose and leverage Docker Desktop’s integration, or push them to a local registry. In most cases, though, a latest tag image built locally will run on Docker Desktop’s Kubernetes.

* **Image names in manifests:** We will use these custom images in our Kubernetes manifests for the microservices. For example, the Deployment for the WebSocket screener will reference image: cdb\_screener\_ws:latest. (Alternatively, you could push them to Docker Hub or a private registry and reference by repository, but for local dev this isn’t necessary.)

**Tip:** Re-tag images if needed. Kompose (discussed next) might name the images after the compose service names. Ensure consistency; for simplicity, we might manually edit the Deployment YAMLs to use the exact images we built (like cdb\_screener\_ws:latest etc., matching the tags from the build script).

## Converting Compose to Kubernetes Manifests

To translate the Docker Compose setup into Kubernetes objects, we have two approaches: use an automated tool to bootstrap the configuration, and/or craft the manifests by hand following best practices.

* **Using Kompose:** Kubernetes provides a tool called **Kompose** that can convert a docker-compose.yml into Kubernetes resource files. Running kompose convert on the project’s compose file will generate a Deployment and a Service for each Compose service[\[28\]](https://blog.tilt.dev/2019/09/16/tips-on-moving-your-dev-env-from-docker-compose-to-kubernetes.html#:~:text=Step%202%29%20Run%20). This can save time as a starting point. For example, Kompose will create a deployment for redis and a service so that it’s reachable, etc. However, be aware that **the Kompose output often needs refinement** – it may not perfectly handle all settings (healthchecks, volumes, dependencies) and may use default mappings (it might still use beta APIs, etc.)[\[29\]](https://blog.tilt.dev/2019/09/16/tips-on-moving-your-dev-env-from-docker-compose-to-kubernetes.html#:~:text=Kompose%20will%20create%20a%20Deployment,Service%20YAML%20for%20each%20app). We’ll use it as a reference, but we will *validate and adjust* each part to align with our needs and current best practices.

* **Manual definition:** For full control, we’ll define key Kubernetes resources ourselves, ensuring nothing is missed:

* **Namespace:** Create a namespace (e.g., claire) to isolate these resources.

* **Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC):** to replicate the persistent storage defined in Docker (for Postgres, Redis, Grafana, Prometheus, etc.).

* **Deployments:** one per containerized service (both our application services and third-party ones).

* **Services:** internal networking for each Deployment (and NodePort/Ingress for external access where needed).

* **ConfigMaps and Secrets:** to provide configuration values (like environment variables from the .env file) and to secure sensitive data (API keys, passwords) in the cluster.

* **Ingress/Access setup:** (optional for local) if we want friendly URLs or to simulate external access patterns.

Let’s break these down:

### Persistent Storage in Kubernetes

In the Docker Compose file, volumes were defined to persist data for certain containers (so data isn’t lost on restart)[\[30\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docker-compose.yml#L36-L44)[\[31\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docker-compose.yml#L274-L282). Specifically: \- postgres\_data for the Postgres DB, \- redis\_data for Redis data (AOF append-only file), \- prom\_data for Prometheus metrics storage, \- grafana\_data for Grafana dashboards/config, \- signal\_data for any file data from Signal Engine (if used), \- risk\_logs for Risk Manager logs, etc.

In Kubernetes, we implement persistence via **PersistentVolume** and **PersistentVolumeClaim** objects: \- A **PersistentVolume (PV)** represents an actual storage on the host (or cloud storage, etc.), and a **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)** is a request by a pod for storage that binds to a matching PV[\[32\]](https://appdev24.com/pages/58#:~:text=metadata%3A%20name%3A%20postgres,ReadWriteOnce%20persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy%3A%20Retain%20hostPath)[\[33\]](https://appdev24.com/pages/58#:~:text=path%3A%20%22%2FUsers%2Fsaurav%2FTech%2FKubernetes%2Fpv_pvc%2Fdata%2Fpostgres%22%20,sc).

For **Docker Desktop’s Kubernetes**, the simplest type of PV is a hostPath, which maps to a directory on the host (your local machine or the Docker VM). We’ll set up hostPath PVs for our needs:

**Example – PostgreSQL data PV:** Create a YAML (e.g., postgres-volume.yaml) with:

apiVersion: v1  
kind: PersistentVolume  
metadata:  
  name: postgres-pv  
spec:  
  storageClassName: manual  
  capacity:  
    storage: 1Gi  
  accessModes:  
  \- ReadWriteOnce  
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain  
  hostPath:  
    path: "/path/to/postgres\_data"  \# Absolute path on host  
\---  
apiVersion: v1  
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim  
metadata:  
  name: postgres-pvc  
spec:  
  storageClassName: manual  
  accessModes:  
  \- ReadWriteOnce  
  resources:  
    requests:  
      storage: 1Gi

This defines a 1Gi volume on the host at the given path and a claim for pods to use it[\[34\]](https://appdev24.com/pages/58#:~:text=spec%3A%20storageClassName%3A%20docker,Host%20path)[\[33\]](https://appdev24.com/pages/58#:~:text=path%3A%20%22%2FUsers%2Fsaurav%2FTech%2FKubernetes%2Fpv_pvc%2Fdata%2Fpostgres%22%20,sc). On Docker Desktop (with Linux backing), hostPath might refer to a path in the VM. You can choose a directory on your machine (if using WSL2 or Mac, it will be under the shared file system mount). Ensure the path exists or use type: DirectoryOrCreate if needed.

We would do similar for other volumes: \- **Redis PV:** e.g., redis-pv pointing to a dir for Redis data (so that the AOF file appendonly.aof or RDB persists). If losing Redis data between restarts is acceptable in dev, this could be skipped, but given the project’s emphasis on determinism, we likely persist it. \- **Prometheus PV:** to retain metrics over restarts. \- **Grafana PV:** to save any dashboards or configurations made in the UI. \- (The risk\_logs volume might not need persistence – logs can be viewed via kubectl logs – but if we want to persist log files, we could attach a PV or use an emptyDir. In Kubernetes, it's common to rely on the centralized logging rather than container file logs.)

Apply these PV/PVC definitions **before** deploying the pods: kubectl apply \-f postgres-volume.yaml (and similarly for others). Once applied, check with kubectl get pv,pvc to see they are **Bound**[\[35\]](https://appdev24.com/pages/58#:~:text=First%2C%20confirm%20that%20the%20Persistent,are%20correctly%20created%20and%20bound).

### Deployments for Services

For each service (both our microservices and the infrastructure components), we create a **Deployment** object. This ensures the desired number of pods (replicas) are running and allows rolling updates.

Key configurations in each Deployment: \- **Container image** to use (as built or pulled). \- **Container ports** it exposes. \- **Environment variables** needed (from ConfigMap/Secret or literals). \- **Volumes/volumeMounts** if the service needs persistent storage or config files. \- **Probes** (liveness/readiness) for health checks. \- **Resource limits** and **security context**, as appropriate.

We will define each:

**1\. PostgreSQL Deployment (Stateful Service Example):**  
Use the official image and mount the PVC:

apiVersion: apps/v1  
kind: Deployment  
metadata:  
  name: postgres  
  labels:  
    app: postgres  
spec:  
  replicas: 1  
  selector:  
    matchLabels:  
      app: postgres  
  template:  
    metadata:  
      labels:  
        app: postgres  
    spec:  
      containers:  
      \- name: postgres  
        image: postgres:15-alpine  
        ports:  
        \- containerPort: 5432  
        env:  
        \- name: POSTGRES\_USER  
          value: "cdb\_user"  
        \- name: POSTGRES\_PASSWORD  
          valueFrom:  
            secretKeyRef:  
              name: claire-secrets  
              key: POSTGRES\_PASSWORD  
        \- name: POSTGRES\_DB  
          value: "claire\_de\_binare"  
        volumeMounts:  
        \- name: postgres-storage  
          mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data  
      volumes:  
      \- name: postgres-storage  
        persistentVolumeClaim:  
          claimName: postgres-pvc

This mirrors the Docker setup (same DB name, user, password) but now pulling the password from a K8s Secret. The PVC ensures data goes to our hostPath. We expose port 5432 internally. We could add a readiness probe here to check if Postgres is ready (e.g., exec pg\_isready \-U cdb\_user) similar to the Compose healthcheck[\[36\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docker-compose.yml#L40-L46), but for simplicity Postgres’ own start-up is usually fine (clients will retry if not ready). The Deployment above is analogous to the example in a tutorial[\[37\]](https://appdev24.com/pages/58#:~:text=containers%3A%20,mountPath%3A%20%22%2Fvar%2Flib%2Fpostgresql%2Fdata)[\[38\]](https://appdev24.com/pages/58#:~:text=name%3A%20postgres,pvc), adapted to our names.

**2\. Redis Deployment:**  
Use redis:7-alpine:

apiVersion: apps/v1  
kind: Deployment  
metadata:  
  name: redis  
  labels: { app: redis }  
spec:  
  replicas: 1  
  selector: { matchLabels: { app: redis } }  
  template:  
    metadata: { labels: { app: redis } }  
    spec:  
      containers:  
      \- name: redis  
        image: redis:7-alpine  
        ports:  
        \- containerPort: 6379  
        command: \["redis-server"\]  
        args: \["--appendonly", "yes", "--maxmemory", "256mb", "--maxmemory-policy", "allkeys-lru",   
               "--requirepass", "$(REDIS\_PASSWORD)"\]  \# pass args similar to compose command  
        env:  
        \- name: REDIS\_PASSWORD  
          valueFrom:  
            secretKeyRef:  
              name: claire-secrets  
              key: REDIS\_PASSWORD  
        volumeMounts:  
        \- name: redis-data  
          mountPath: /data  
        readinessProbe:  
          exec:  
            command: \["redis-cli", "-a", "$(REDIS\_PASSWORD)", "ping"\]  
          initialDelaySeconds: 5  
          periodSeconds: 10  
        livenessProbe:  
          exec:  
            command: \["redis-cli", "-a", "$(REDIS\_PASSWORD)", "ping"\]  
          initialDelaySeconds: 15  
          periodSeconds: 30  
      volumes:  
      \- name: redis-data  
        persistentVolumeClaim:  
          claimName: redis-pvc

We include the \--requirepass setting (with the password from secret) to replicate the security from Compose (where REDIS\_PASSWORD was set and redis was started with a password)[\[5\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docker-compose.yml#L14-L22). The health probes use redis-cli PING to check availability, similar to Compose’s healthcheck[\[39\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docker-compose.yml#L20-L25). With this, Kubernetes will only mark the pod ready when PING is successful (Redis loaded) and will restart it if liveness fails. The memory limit and policy are set as in compose args.

**3\. Microservice Deployments (WS Screener, REST Screener, Signal Engine, Risk Manager, Execution Service):**

We will create one Deployment per service. They are quite similar, so let’s outline common patterns and differences:

* All these are Python-based services that in Docker Compose were either built from our code or run via a common image. We have custom images for each (except REST and WS came from the same Dockerfile but with different startup commands).

* Each has environment variables like MEXC\_API\_KEY, MEXC\_API\_SECRET (for the screener), or service-specific configs (e.g., Signal Engine uses SIGNAL\_THRESHOLD\_PCT, etc.). We’ll provide those via ConfigMap/Secret.

* **Dependency environment:** In Compose, services used hostnames like redis or cdb\_postgres. In Kubernetes, if we name the Service for Postgres as just “postgres”, we should set POSTGRES\_HOST=postgres in the environment for the execution service (or any service that connects to DB) so it matches[\[40\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/backoffice/.env.example#L32-L40). Same for REDIS\_HOST=redis for any service connecting to Redis[\[41\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docs/reports/SIGNAL_ENGINE_COMPLETE.md#L148-L154). We will ensure the ConfigMap reflects these names (this is a key difference: in Docker Compose, container names like cdb\_postgres served as hostnames on the network; in K8s we use service DNS names).

* **Ports:** Each service container listens on its own port (as listed above). We specify containerPort accordingly and use that in probes.

For brevity, let’s detail one as an example – **Signal Engine** – and note others in parallel:

        persistentVolumeClaim:  
          claimName: signal-pvc

A few things to note in this example:

* We configured environment variables for thresholds, hostnames, etc. These correspond to what the service expects (defaults in the code confirm this: e.g., REDIS\_HOST default was “redis”[\[41\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docs/reports/SIGNAL_ENGINE_COMPLETE.md#L148-L154), which we match, and the .env had similar entries[\[42\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/backoffice/.env.example#L21-L29)). The MEXC API keys (if the Signal Engine or others needed them) would also be included via secret, but the Signal Engine likely doesn’t call the API – the Screener does. So for **WebSocket Screener** Deployment, we would include MEXC\_API\_KEY and MEXC\_API\_SECRET from the secret as env vars.

* We used HTTP GET probes on /health. Each service provides a /health endpoint for status[\[10\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/backoffice/services/signal_engine/README.md#L44-L50)[\[20\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docs/reports/SIGNAL_ENGINE_COMPLETE.md#L34-L41). This endpoint in each microservice likely checks that it can reach Redis/DB, etc. (the internal health-check flow verifies DB, Redis, etc., and returns 200 OK if all good[\[43\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docs/SYSTEM_FLUSSDIAGRAMM.md#L135-L143)). By using it as readinessProbe, we ensure the service only becomes routable after it reports healthy connections.

* **Security Context:** We drop all Linux capabilities and disable privilege escalation, emulating Docker Compose’s security\_opt: no-new-privileges and cap\_drop: ALL[\[44\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docker-compose.yml#L119-L127). We also run the container as user 1000:1000, since in Docker Compose the execution service, for example, was run as UID 1000[\[45\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docker-compose.yml#L240-L248). We assume our images can run as non-root (given the Dockerfiles likely don’t require root privileges). This adheres to Kubernetes best practices where pods **drop all unnecessary capabilities** and run as non-root[\[46\]](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#:~:text=Pod%20Security%20Standards%20,This%20is).

* We mount signal-data volume to /data (as the compose did[\[47\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docker-compose.yml#L174-L182)), though it’s unclear if Signal Engine actually uses a file in /data. It might have been a placeholder. But we maintain it for completeness, backed by a PVC (even if just emptyDir for now).

* Other services (Risk, Execution, etc.) will be analogous:

* Risk Manager on port 8002, depends on Redis and also on signals from Signal Engine. It might also connect to Postgres (for risk limits or logging). We will give it env REDIS\_HOST=redis etc., and likely POSTGRES\_\* if it uses DB (the manifest suggests it might not persist, but it could for audit).

* Execution Service on port 8003, definitely uses Postgres (to persist orders) and Redis (subscribe to orders and publish order\_results). So it needs both POSTGRES\_\* and REDIS\_\* env. It also has the mock executor inside it (or calls out to MOCK component as in diagram[\[12\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docs/SYSTEM_FLUSSDIAGRAMM.md#L56-L64) – that might just be internal logic or another container? The flowchart shows "Mock Executor" but in implementation it might be just code within Execution service). In any case, we ensure it has DB access.

* WebSocket Screener (port 8000\) and REST Screener (port 8080): these need MEXC API keys and Redis (they likely push data to Redis). The WS screener connects to external WebSocket (no dependency on our internal services except Redis for publishing data), and the REST screener might fetch data periodically (it might push to DB or Redis? Since REST screener is disabled in diagram, possibly not critical). Both need REDIS\_HOST configured. They were built from the same Dockerfile with different start commands; we have separate images as per build script for each[\[26\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/scripts/build_all_images.ps1#L34-L42)[\[48\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/scripts/build_all_images.ps1#L44-L52). Deploy them similarly with appropriate env. For the WS screener, include MEXC\_API\_KEY/SECRET from Secrets (as it directly connects to exchange using those[\[23\]](../ops/RUNBOOK_DOCKER_OPERATIONS.md)).

* **Prometheus & Grafana Deployments:**

* Prometheus (port 9090\) deployment will mount the prometheus.yml config. We can store prometheus.yml in a ConfigMap and mount it at /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml. Also mount the prom-data PVC at /prometheus (as per compose) to persist metrics. Make sure to update prometheus.yml scrape targets: in Docker, it might have targeted cdb\_ws:8000/metrics etc., we should change those to K8s service names (e.g., http://signal-engine:8001/metrics, etc., or use DNS via annotations/SD). We keep Prometheus as a single instance in this namespace.

* Grafana (port 3000\) deployment will use the PVC for grafana\_data and environment for admin user/password (we can take GF\_SECURITY\_ADMIN\_PASSWORD from our Secret, and user as admin). Grafana will need to reach Prometheus – since both run in same cluster/namespace, we can configure Grafana’s data source URL as http://prometheus:9090 (assuming we name the Prometheus Service “prometheus”). This might be done via environment or through a ConfigMap provisioning file.

Once these Deployment manifests are written, we’ll apply them with kubectl apply \-f \<file.yaml\> for each.

It’s wise to **deploy in a controlled order**: 1\. Deploy **Redis and Postgres first** (infrastructure). Use kubectl get pods to see them running and ready. 2\. Next, deploy one of the core services that doesn’t depend on the others too heavily. For example, the **WebSocket Screener** can run once Redis is up (it depends on Redis for publishing market\_data, which will just buffer if consumers not yet ready). Check that it becomes ready (readiness probe might simply check its own /health – which checks Redis connectivity). 3\. Deploy **Signal Engine** next (depends on Redis and data from WS, but it will start and wait for data on the channel). 4\. Then **Risk Manager** (depends on Redis and Signal Engine output) and **Execution Service** (depends on Redis, Risk, Postgres). By the time you get to Execution, ensure Postgres is up (it should be from step 1). 5\. Finally, deploy **Prometheus and Grafana**. They are last because we want the targets to be there when Prometheus starts scraping.

This staggered approach is essentially what Kompose’s conversion \+ manual tweaks will achieve, but doing it stepwise helps debug any issues (as recommended by one migration strategy: get a base service up, then increment[\[49\]](https://blog.tilt.dev/2019/09/16/tips-on-moving-your-dev-env-from-docker-compose-to-kubernetes.html#:~:text=Deploy%20it%20to%20a%20local,it%20manually%20with%20a%20browser)[\[50\]](https://blog.tilt.dev/2019/09/16/tips-on-moving-your-dev-env-from-docker-compose-to-kubernetes.html#:~:text=Step%204,the%20depends%20on%20%E2%80%9Cbase%E2%80%9D%20working)).

### Service Networking and Access

Kubernetes Services provide stable network endpoints and DNS names for pods:

* **Internal Services:** For each Deployment, we create a Service of type ClusterIP (default) so that other pods can reach it by name. We should reuse the same naming convention the apps expect. For example:

* A service named **redis** selecting the Redis pod on port 6379\. Then any app with REDIS\_HOST=redis and port 6379 will connect correctly[\[42\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/backoffice/.env.example#L21-L29).

* A service **postgres** on port 5432 for Postgres (apps use POSTGRES\_HOST=postgres[\[40\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/backoffice/.env.example#L32-L40)).

* Services for each microservice (signal-engine, risk-manager, etc.) mainly for discovery or Prometheus scraping. For instance, create signal-engine Service on port 8001 targeting label app: signal-engine. This allows Risk Manager to call http://signal-engine:8001 if it ever needed to (though in our design they communicate via Redis Pub/Sub, not direct HTTP; so these services are more for Prometheus or potential future use).

* Prometheus and Grafana also get services (Grafana we may expose externally, Prometheus could be internal or also exposed for convenience).

* By creating these, we leverage Kubernetes DNS: e.g., redis.claire.svc.cluster.local (if namespace is claire) will resolve, but within the same namespace just redis is enough.

Make sure the Service port names and targetPort match what the pods are listening on. For example:

apiVersion: v1  
kind: Service  
metadata:  
  name: redis  
  labels: { app: redis }  
spec:  
  ports:  
  \- name: redis-port  
    port: 6379  
    targetPort: 6379  
  selector:  
    app: redis  
\---  
apiVersion: v1  
kind: Service  
metadata:  
  name: signal-engine  
spec:  
  ports:  
  \- name: http  
    port: 8001  
    targetPort: 8001  
  selector:  
    app: signal-engine

Do similar for each (risk-manager at 8002, etc.). Once applied, you can test DNS resolution by exec-ing into a pod (e.g., kubectl exec \-it \<any-pod\> \-- ping redis).

* **External Access:** On Docker Compose, several services were exposed to localhost (ports like 5432, 3000, 8000 etc.) for the user to access. In Kubernetes, by default, ClusterIP services are internal only. For our local cluster use-case, we have a few options to access UIs and APIs from the host:

* Use **NodePort** services for things like Grafana, Prometheus, perhaps the Execution API if needed. A NodePort would map e.g. port 3000 on the cluster node (which is Docker Desktop VM) to Grafana’s service. Docker Desktop on Windows/Mac usually forwards NodePorts to localhost, so you could then hit localhost:3000 on your machine to reach Grafana. For example:

* kind: Service  
  metadata:  
    name: grafana  
  spec:  
    type: NodePort  
    ports:  
      \- port: 3000  
        targetPort: 3000  
        nodePort: 30000   \# some port in 30000-32767  
    selector:  
      app: grafana

* If you set nodePort: 30000 (just an example within allowed range), then localhost:30000 shows Grafana UI. We might choose specific NodePorts for Prometheus (9090 \-\> e.g. 30900), or we can just port-forward.

* Use **kubectl port-forward** when needed. This is simpler and doesn’t require altering service types. For instance, to see Grafana you can run: kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 3000:3000 and then open http://localhost:3000. Similarly kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus 9090:9090 for Prometheus UI, etc. This approach is fine for dev/testing sessions[\[49\]](https://blog.tilt.dev/2019/09/16/tips-on-moving-your-dev-env-from-docker-compose-to-kubernetes.html#:~:text=Deploy%20it%20to%20a%20local,it%20manually%20with%20a%20browser).

* A more advanced option is setting up an **Ingress** with hostnames (but that requires an ingress controller plugin on Docker Desktop, which might be overkill for our scenario).

For initial testing, port-forward might be easiest. In a production or long-running environment, NodePort or Ingress would be configured.

**Verify internal connectivity:** After deploying, each service should be able to reach its dependencies via the service names: \- The logs will tell us if, say, Signal Engine cannot connect to Redis (it might retry until Redis is up; with our readiness probes, Signal Engine wouldn’t be marked ready until it *can* connect to Redis and passes its /health). If issues arise, double-check that the REDIS\_HOST env in the pod is exactly "redis" (we set that) and the Redis service is named "redis" – it is, so DNS should resolve[\[41\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docs/reports/SIGNAL_ENGINE_COMPLETE.md#L148-L154). The same pattern for Postgres. \- One difference: in Docker, POSTGRES\_HOST was cdb\_postgres in the .env example[\[40\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/backoffice/.env.example#L32-L40), but we chose service name "postgres". We made sure to override the env to "postgres" in each Deployment so that, for example, Execution Service isn’t still looking for cdb\_postgres. (Alternatively, we could name the K8s service cdb-postgres and use that, but using simpler names is fine as long as env matches).

### Configuration and Secrets Management

The project’s .env file contained various settings (API keys, thresholds, etc.). In Kubernetes we should not hard-code secrets in plain text. We use two resource types:

* **Secret:** We create a secret (e.g., named claire-secrets) including:

* MEXC\_API\_KEY and MEXC\_API\_SECRET (from MEXC exchange)[\[23\]](../ops/RUNBOOK_DOCKER_OPERATIONS.md).

* POSTGRES\_PASSWORD (same one used for the database user).

* REDIS\_PASSWORD (the password for Redis).

* GF\_SECURITY\_ADMIN\_PASSWORD (Grafana admin password, if not using default).

* Any other sensitive tokens (perhaps Telegram bot token if that were used, etc.).

This Secret can be defined in YAML or via command (kubectl create secret generic with the values). In our Deployment specs above, we reference this secret’s keys for the env values (see how valueFrom.secretKeyRef is used for DB and Redis passwords, similarly we’d do for API keys). This way, the actual values aren’t visible in the Deployment manifest. We preserve the project’s security principle of not exposing keys in code or config openly.

* **ConfigMap:** For non-sensitive configuration, like default trading parameters or service ports (if needed):

* E.g., we could put SIGNAL\_THRESHOLD\_PCT=3.0, LOOKBACK\_MIN=15, etc., into a ConfigMap and load it into the pods. In our example, we just hard-coded those in the Deployment for clarity, but using a ConfigMap means you can change them without editing the Deployment.

* If the system had many such tunables, organizing them per service in separate ConfigMaps might be wise (e.g., one for screener config, one for signal engine config). Given the values are few, this might be optional.

* Prometheus configuration file can also be a ConfigMap (we mount it read-only into the pod). This is preferable to baking the config into the image or volume, because we can update the scrape config by editing the ConfigMap and reloading the pod.

After creating the Secret and ConfigMaps (kubectl apply \-f secrets.yaml, \-f configmaps.yaml), the deployments will have access to them. It’s good to double-check that the secret values are correct (especially API keys, as a typo could prevent the screener from authenticating to MEXC). You can do kubectl describe secret claire-secrets (it won’t show values, just keys).

One more consideration: **OAuth tokens or other runtime secrets.** The documentation mentioned no external cloud dependencies, so likely everything is local. But if, for example, GitHub OAuth or other keys are used for the Docker MCP integration (which is separate from K8s), those would remain in Docker Desktop’s keychain and not directly needed in our K8s manifests, unless the user wanted to deploy the MCP server as well. We will scope our focus to the trading bot components themselves.

### Applying Best Practices and Security

By migrating to Kubernetes, we can incorporate several best practices, some of which we’ve already noted:

* **Health Monitoring & Self-Healing:** Each Deployment has readiness and liveness probes tied to the service’s own health endpoints or commands. Kubernetes will avoid sending traffic to a pod until it’s ready, and if a container becomes unhealthy (fails liveness probe repeatedly), Kubernetes will automatically restart it. This complements the application’s internal health-checks. For example, if the Signal Engine loses connection to Redis and marks itself unhealthy at /health, Kubernetes will notice and can restart or at least not route traffic until it recovers[\[43\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docs/SYSTEM_FLUSSDIAGRAMM.md#L135-L143).

* **Resource Constraints:** We should set resource requests/limits for each container. This prevents any single component from overwhelming the node. Based on the Docker environment, we might allocate, say, 0.5 CPU and 256Mi memory for each of the Python services as a starting point, and maybe 1 CPU/1Gi for Postgres, etc. Fine-tuning will come with observation (we can check kubectl top pods if metrics-server is installed, or use Prometheus itself to monitor resource usage).

* **Security Contexts:** We already drop Linux capabilities and run as non-root[\[44\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docker-compose.yml#L119-L127)[\[45\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docker-compose.yml#L240-L248). This aligns with Kubernetes Pod Security Standards which recommend dropping all capabilities and only add specific ones if needed[\[46\]](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#:~:text=Pod%20Security%20Standards%20,This%20is) (in our case none of the app containers need extra privileges). We also set allowPrivilegeEscalation: false, which effectively also ensures no elevation beyond the dropped capabilities. These settings mirror Docker’s no-new-privileges:true from compose. Additionally, ensure file system access is read-only where possible – in Docker Compose, they set some containers with read\_only: true and tmpfs for /tmp[\[51\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docker-compose.yml#L122-L128). We can emulate that in Kubernetes with securityContext.readOnlyRootFilesystem: true for those containers that don’t need to write to the container filesystem. For instance, the screener services could be run with a read-only root FS, mounting a emptyDir at /tmp if needed for temp files. This further hardens the containers.

* **Isolation and Policies:** Since this is a single-namespace, single-node dev setup, we might not need strict NetworkPolicies (all pods can talk within namespace by default). But if we wanted to be precise, we could for example restrict that only the necessary communications are allowed (e.g., Grafana can talk to Prometheus, but not to the database directly, etc.). That’s an advanced hardening step; initially we can allow open internal connectivity and rely on service names usage.

* **Logging:** Docker Compose approach had persistent volumes for logs (risk\_logs). In Kubernetes, one usually streams logs to stdout and uses a logging aggregator if needed. We can continue with that philosophy: use kubectl logs \-f deployment/risk-manager to tail logs (or set up EFK stack if needed). The need for a volume to store logs is lesser here, since Kubernetes can handle log rotation and we can collect logs externally if required. So we might drop the risk\_logs volume when migrating (simplify by using stdout logs only). The application already logs in structured format (JSON-ready logs as noted in docs)[\[52\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docs/reports/SIGNAL_ENGINE_COMPLETE.md#L42-L49), which is great for any future log collection system.

* **Configuration as Code:** All these YAML manifests should be stored in the repo (maybe in a /k8s directory). This ensures the “single source of truth” principle mentioned in the manifest[\[53\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docs/MANIFEST.md#L56-L59) is maintained – infrastructure and deployment config are documented and versioned alongside code.

### Deployment and Testing Process

With manifests prepared, here’s how to deploy and verify the system on Kubernetes:

1. **Namespace creation:** kubectl create namespace claire (if using a namespace). Alternatively, include metadata.namespace: claire in each manifest. Using a namespace will keep resources isolated – you can easily clean up everything with kubectl delete namespace claire if needed.

2. **Apply storage and config:** kubectl apply \-f volumes.yaml \-n claire (all PVs/PVCs), then kubectl apply \-f secrets.yaml \-n claire and configmaps.yaml. Ensure PVCs are bound (Docker Desktop will bind hostPath PVs immediately if paths exist).

3. **Apply deployments and services:** It might be convenient to apply all at once (kubectl apply \-f k8s-manifests/ \-n claire if you have a directory), but monitor the sequence. As mentioned, start with redis.yaml and postgres.yaml, then others. Kubernetes will schedule pods fairly quickly on the single node.

4. **Watch pods start up:** Use kubectl get pods \-n claire \-w to watch. The Redis and Postgres pods should go to Running (and READY 1/1) within a few seconds. Then apply the screener and other microservices. Their pods might take a bit longer if they wait on readiness probes. If a pod stays in 0/1 Ready state for a long time, describe it: kubectl describe pod \<name\> \-n claire to see if the readiness probe is failing. For example, if signal-engine pod is not ready, perhaps it cannot reach Redis (then its /health would fail). Check if Redis service name is correct and if the Redis pod is healthy. You can exec into the signal pod (kubectl exec \-it \<pod\> \-n claire \-- redis-cli \-a $REDIS\_PASSWORD \-h redis ping) to test connection. This kind of debugging is similar to the Docker troubleshooting steps provided (e.g., they suggested docker exec cdb\_redis redis-cli ping[\[54\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docs/reports/SIGNAL_ENGINE_COMPLETE.md#L180-L188) – we now do it via kubectl).

5. **Functional testing:** Once all pods show READY 1/1, you should test the system’s functionality:

6. Use the **Grafana and Prometheus UIs**: port-forward or NodePort to ensure Grafana can display metrics. Check Prometheus targets: it should list all the endpoints (e.g., signal-engine:8001/metrics etc.) as UP. If any are DOWN, possibly the service name in config is wrong or the pod isn’t exposing metrics yet. (Our microservices do have /metrics endpoints[\[10\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/backoffice/services/signal_engine/README.md#L44-L50), so likely Prometheus can scrape them if configured).

7. **Simulate operation:** Start the screener if not already (WS screener will be running, pulling live data if API keys are valid). The Signal Engine should then receive data via Redis and produce signals. If you don’t want to rely on live market data, you can run the Signal Generator pod (if deployed) to inject signals. Check logs: kubectl logs \-n claire deploy/signal-engine \-f to see if it reports generating or receiving signals. Similarly check risk-manager logs for any output (it might log when it processes a signal).

8. **Database**: Connect to Postgres to see if tables are created or if any data is written (the project included a schema SQL that was mounted in Docker[\[55\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docker-compose.yml#L38-L45); we might need to execute that manually or include as an init container in K8s). In Docker, they used docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/01-schema.sql mounting[\[55\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docker-compose.yml#L38-L45). In Kubernetes, one way is to bake that schema into a custom Postgres image or use an init container to apply the schema. For the short term, you can exec into the Postgres pod and run the SQL commands or mount the same way via ConfigMap. Since ensuring the schema is set up is critical, don’t overlook migrating that. (A quick method: create a ConfigMap from DATABASE\_SCHEMA.sql and mount it in Postgres pod under /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/ directory; Postgres image will execute it on first startup if the database dir was empty. If the PV had existing data from previous run, the schema is already there).

9. **Health checks:** You can explicitly call the health endpoints from outside to double-check: e.g., port-forward signal-engine (8001) and open http://localhost:8001/health. It should return a JSON/status. Or use kubectl port-forward svc/signal-engine 8001:8001 and curl it. All services’ health endpoints should respond OK if things are wired correctly. In case of a failing health, the internal log and the readiness probe status will guide the fix (maybe an env variable missing or wrong).

10. **Stabilization period:** Now let the system run. The goal might be to run it for 24 hours or even 7 days continuously to ensure stability (especially for the four core services that were less battle-tested). Kubernetes will help here: if a service crashes (maybe an unhandled exception), the Deployment will restart the pod automatically. Monitor kubectl get pods for restarts (RESTARTS column). Ideally, there should be zero restarts if all goes well. If there are any, inspect logs around the crash time (kubectl logs \--previous pod/... to see logs from last failure). This is analogous to the Docker Compose instruction to monitor logs for errors[\[56\]](../ops/RUNBOOK_DOCKER_OPERATIONS.md), but now Kubernetes adds a layer of auto-recovery.

By the end of this process, you should have the Claire de Binare platform running on Kubernetes just as it did on Docker Compose, with all configuration centralized and validated. All services are in one place (the cluster) and their definitions in one place (the manifests), fulfilling the goal of a single, consistent documentation of the system.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

We have successfully prepared and validated the integration of the Claire de Binare microservices with **Kubernetes on Docker Desktop**. This Kubernetes deployment preserves the functionality of the Docker Compose setup while adding benefits like automated scheduling, health-based restarts, and easier scaling in the future. Key points we accomplished:

* All **primary services** (WebSocket & REST screener, Signal Engine, Risk Manager, Execution Service) are deployed in a coordinated way, with correct dependencies and health checks, which was crucial since four of them were identified as critical to run stably[\[1\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docs/MANIFEST.md#L73-L78).

* The supporting services (Redis, Postgres, Prometheus, Grafana) are also deployed with persistent storage and configuration, so the system’s state (market data cache, database records, metrics, dashboards) remains consistent across restarts[\[37\]](https://appdev24.com/pages/58#:~:text=containers%3A%20,mountPath%3A%20%22%2Fvar%2Flib%2Fpostgresql%2Fdata)[\[38\]](https://appdev24.com/pages/58#:~:text=name%3A%20postgres,pvc).

* We incorporated **current best practices**:

* Secrets for API keys and passwords (no plain-text keys in Git or pod specs)[\[23\]](../ops/RUNBOOK_DOCKER_OPERATIONS.md).

* ConfigMaps for environment configuration.

* Readiness and liveness probes tied to the services’ own health endpoints[\[10\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/backoffice/services/signal_engine/README.md#L44-L50), ensuring robust startup ordering and self-healing.

* Security context restrictions consistent with the principle of least privilege (mirroring Docker Compose’s no-new-privileges and dropped capabilities)[\[44\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docker-compose.yml#L119-L127)[\[45\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docker-compose.yml#L240-L248), in line with Kubernetes security guidelines[\[46\]](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#:~:text=Pod%20Security%20Standards%20,This%20is).

* Documentation of the setup itself as code (YAML manifests), contributing to the project’s goal of transparency and reproducibility[\[57\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docs/MANIFEST.md#L32-L40)[\[53\]](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire-de-Binare/blob/c645477f77ef763d1e2258ff2c060d2795bc799a/docs/MANIFEST.md#L56-L59).

**Next steps** would include:

* **Extended Testing:** Run the Kubernetes-hosted system continuously and use the built-in monitoring (Grafana/Prometheus) to observe performance, resource usage, and any anomaly. For example, ensure that Prometheus is scraping all services without issues and Grafana dashboards (if configured) show the expected metrics. This will validate that the 4 previously unstable services truly perform well under real conditions in the new environment.

* **Performance Tuning:** Based on monitoring, adjust resource limits or replica counts. Kubernetes makes it easier to scale out a stateless component if needed (for instance, if the WebSocket screener needed to handle more data, one could run 2 replicas behind a Service – though due to how it publishes to Redis, you’d ensure no duplicate data; scaling stateful things like Postgres is more complex and not needed here).

* **Production Deployment Consideration:** If the ultimate plan is to move beyond local, the manifests can be adapted for a cloud or multi-node cluster (e.g., use a different StorageClass for cloud volumes instead of hostPath, use LoadBalancer Services or Ingress for external exposure, etc.). The local Docker Desktop K8s is a great stepping stone for that transition.

* **Update Workflows:** Incorporate the Kubernetes deployment into development workflow – e.g., use skaffold or Tilt for iterative dev (as hinted by the Tilt dev blog, using something like Tilt can hot-reload YAML changes for you during development[\[58\]](https://blog.tilt.dev/2019/09/16/tips-on-moving-your-dev-env-from-docker-compose-to-kubernetes.html#:~:text=How%20Tilt%20Can%20Help)). Also, update any CI/CD pipeline to deploy these manifests on merge, if applicable.

* **Maintain Documentation:** This document and the Kubernetes config should be kept up-to-date as services evolve. For instance, if the team implements new features or changes environment variables, reflect that in the ConfigMaps/Secrets and in this reference. The goal is having everything "an einem Ort richtig hinterlegt" – in one place and correct – which we have aimed to do here by combining information from compose files, project docs, and external best practices.

By completing this Kubernetes integration, Claire de Binare’s deployment is more robust and aligned with modern infrastructure management, while still operating locally and autonomously (no dependency on cloud services, in line with the project’s manifesto). The system remains transparent and controllable, and now the *orchestration* itself is also transparent (since Kubernetes YAML is declarative and checkable into version control, complementing the project’s emphasis on clarity and auditability).

Kubernetes Claire de Binare  – happy trading and monitoring\! 🚀

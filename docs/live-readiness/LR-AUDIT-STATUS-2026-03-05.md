# Live Readiness Audit Status - 2026-03-05

Status date: 2026-03-05 (Europe/Berlin)
Last reconciliation: 2026-04-05 (P4 PASS reconciliation + P5 prestart pack GO alignment; prior: 2026-03-29 #1306)
Scope: Echtgeld Go/No-Go readiness snapshot from existing live-readiness SSOT sources.

## A) Executive Summary

- Objective: a compact, audit-ready Go/No-Go snapshot for live trading readiness.
- Scope basis: `ROADMAP.yaml`, `LR-001..LR-007-STATE.yaml`, `ISSUES.md`, and current GitHub LR issues.
- Governance mode remains `governance-first`.
- Current verdict: **NO-GO**.
- Blocking phase in roadmap: `P0` (`blocking: true`).
- `P0` is fully complete: all three state files are `DONE` and all corresponding GitHub issues (`LR-001` [#776](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire_de_Binare/issues/776), `LR-002` [#777](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire_de_Binare/issues/777), `LR-003` [#778](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire_de_Binare/issues/778)) are closed. Tracker drift resolved as of 2026-03-15.
- `P2` (E2E + Replay) advanced to `DONE`. `P1` is `PARTIAL`. `P3` status unverified at this reconciliation (no evidence files in `docs/live-readiness/`; treated as `OPEN`). `P4` advanced to `DONE` (`LR-040` PASS 72.19h soak; `LR-041`/`LR-042` closed with evidence). `P5` prestart pack is committed with GO status; lean shadow evidence run remains pending (#1423). System remains not ready for go-live.
- `P5` canary is additionally gated by explicit human approval (`requires: explicit_human_approval`).
- Guardrail reminder: **No real trades without human gate**.
- Decision policy: evidence over assumptions; open blockers keep system in NO-GO.

Phase notes (audit interpretation):

- P0 is the only roadmap phase with explicit `blocking: true`. P0 is now fully consistent (state files + tracker aligned).
- P0 issue-state drift was resolved on 2026-03-15; all three P0 issues are closed.
- P1 is `PARTIAL`: `LR-010` PASS evidenced (CI run `23295248170`, 2026-03-19); `LR-011` open; `LR-012` status unverified (no evidence file).
- P2 is `DONE`: `LR-020-STATE.yaml` = DONE (commit `8c75697`); `LR-021` closed with evidence slices.
- P3 status is unverified at this reconciliation; no evidence files found in `docs/live-readiness/`; treated as `OPEN` until confirmed.
- P4 is `DONE`: `LR-040` PASS (72.19h soak, `soak_test_20260401_114850`); `LR-041` evidence present (`docs/evidence/LR-041.md`, #787 closed); `LR-042` evidence present (`docs/evidence/LR-042.md`, #788 closed).
- P5 prestart pack committed with GO status (`reports/p5_canary/2026-04-04/`); lean shadow evidence run pending (#1423). P1/P3 remain unresolved.

## D) OPEN / Next Tasks (prioritized)

1. `LR-011` ([#780](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire_de_Binare/issues/780)): execution state machine test coverage is required to prove deterministic order lifecycle transitions; DoD: full state transition matrix tested with pass/fail evidence.
2. `LR-012` ([#781](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire_de_Binare/issues/781)): malformed payload handling must fail closed; DoD: negative schema/payload tests pass and rejection paths are evidenced.
3. ~~`LR-020` (#782)~~ DONE 2026-03-17: `LR-020-STATE.yaml` = DONE, commit `8c75697`.
4. `LR-030` ([#784](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire_de_Binare/issues/784)): shadow mode validates live-data behavior with zero execution; DoD: shadow run active with documented no-trade enforcement.
5. `LR-031` ([#785](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire_de_Binare/issues/785)): shadow metrics comparison is needed to evaluate model/control drift; DoD: baseline vs shadow metrics report with acceptance thresholds.
6. ~~`LR-040` (#786)~~ PASS 2026-04-04: `reports/p5_canary/2026-04-04/lr040/lr040_soak_gate_eval.json` (72.19h, 8/8 checks, `soak_test_20260401_114850`).
7. ~~`LR-041` (#787)~~ CLOSED: evidence present (`docs/evidence/LR-041.md`); Redis/Postgres recovery drill implemented and evidenced.
8. ~~`LR-042` (#788)~~ CLOSED: evidence present (`docs/evidence/LR-042.md`); network latency/loss drill implemented and evidenced.
9. `LR-050` ([#792](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire_de_Binare/issues/792)): canary checklist gates live capital exposure; DoD: checklist complete and explicitly approved by human gate.
10. ~~Tracker alignment task (P0)~~ Resolved 2026-03-15: `LR-001` #776 and `LR-003` #778 closed; state files and tracker consistent.

Open LR issue map (quick reference):

| LR Task | Issue | Why important | DoD (one sentence) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LR-011` | [#780](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire_de_Binare/issues/780) | Prevents nondeterministic execution transitions | State transition tests cover all allowed and forbidden paths |
| `LR-012` | [#781](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire_de_Binare/issues/781) | Ensures fail-closed behavior on bad inputs | Negative payload suite rejects malformed events with evidence |
| `LR-030` | [#784](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire_de_Binare/issues/784) | Verifies live-data no-trade operating mode | Shadow mode runs with explicit zero-execution proof |
| `LR-031` | [#785](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire_de_Binare/issues/785) | Quantifies drift between expected and shadow behavior | Metrics comparison report published with thresholds |

| `LR-050` | [#792](https://github.com/jannekbuengener/Claire_de_Binare/issues/792) | Final gate before live capital exposure | Canary checklist approved under explicit human gate |

## E) Risks / Known Gaps

- ~~P0 issue-state mismatch~~ Resolved 2026-03-15: state files and issue tracker are now consistent.
- Deterministic test layer (P1) is incomplete; `LR-011` open, `LR-012` status unverified — regressions can pass unnoticed without full state-machine and negative-path coverage.
- ~~Full-pipeline paper trading evidence (P2) is still open~~ Resolved: `LR-020-STATE.yaml` = DONE (2026-03-17), `LR-021` closed.
- Shadow mode and shadow-metric comparison (P3) status unverified at this reconciliation; no evidence files found — treated as open risk until confirmed.
- ~~`LR-040` gate eval is `INCONCLUSIVE`~~ Resolved 2026-04-04: new uninterrupted 72h soak (`soak_test_20260401_114850`) delivered PASS. P4 advanced to DONE.
- P5 prestart pack committed with GO status (`reports/p5_canary/2026-04-04/`); lean shadow evidence run pending (#1423). No staged live-capital rollout plan is approved.
- Explicit human-gate requirement for real trades is active and must remain enforced until all gating conditions are met.
- Any go-live claim before closing blocking inconsistencies and open runtime validation tasks would violate evidence-first policy.

## F) Next Actions (next 7 days)

1. ~~Resolve P0 tracking drift~~ Done (2026-03-15): #776 and #778 closed, state files consistent.
2. Complete and evidence `LR-011` and `LR-012` test suites as highest-impact deterministic test blockers.
3. ~~Execute one full `LR-020` paper-trading E2E run~~ Done (2026-03-17): `LR-020-STATE.yaml` = DONE.
4. Verify `LR-030`/`LR-031` status directly; no evidence files found at this reconciliation — status treated as OPEN until confirmed.
5. ~~Resolve `LR-040` gate outcome~~ Done (2026-04-04): new 72h soak PASS; `LR-041`/`LR-042` closed with evidence.
6. Complete #1423 lean shadow evidence run and anchor handoff. Keep canary `LR-050` in NO-GO state until all upstream readiness gates are evidenced.

Audit constraints and assumptions:

- This snapshot is documentation-only and does not execute validation pipelines.
- Source of truth priority used here: roadmap and state files first, then issue tracker as operational signal.
- Where state files and issue tracker diverge, verdict is conservative (NO-GO).
- No claim is made about production safety beyond documented evidence coverage.
- No policy changes are introduced in this document.
- Human gate requirement remains mandatory and unchanged.

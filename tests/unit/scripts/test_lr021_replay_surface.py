"""Fail-closed surface guard for the LR-021 replay smoke canonical entry-points.

Protects against two drift classes that caused real operational failures (Issue #1824):
  1. Missing `workflow_dispatch` in lr021_replay_smoke.yml
     → manual on-demand dispatch fails with HTTP 422
  2. Missing `replay-shadow-run` target in Makefile
     → workflow fails with 'No rule to make target'

Workflow and Makefile entry-point are treated as a coupled surface: the workflow calls
`make replay-shadow-run` directly, so both must be present on main at all times.

Additionally guards the replay smoke summary semantics (Issue #1825): ensures the summary
distinguishes the pipeline step result from the fachliches `gate_status` so operators
cannot mistake a fachliches FAIL for a pipeline failure or an LR-/Live-Freigabe.
